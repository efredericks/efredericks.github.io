  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Valley State University</a>, formerly at <a href="http://www.oakland.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oakland University</a>. I received my PhD from <a href="http://www.msu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michigan State University</a> in 2015, exploring how uncertainty can impact self-adaptive systems at different levels of abstraction and how it can be mitigated by using search-based software engineering techniques.</p>
  <p>Previously, I worked for <a href="http://www.conti-online.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continental Automotive Systems</a> as a software engineer / software project manager, focusing on developing safety systems that help to reduce the amount of traffic accidents.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>research interests</h2>
  <p>I am interested in the application of evolutionary computation to cyber-physical systems, specifically those that can be modeled as self-adaptive systems (SAS). In doing so, Iâ€™ve been researching how software engineering techniques can be augmented with evolutionary search, specifically in the areas of software modeling, requirements analysis, and run-time testing. If you are interested in any of the following areas of research, please feel free to contact me!</p>
